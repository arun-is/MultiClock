# MultiClock
Chrome extensions that shows multiple clocks in chrome new tabs. Useful for remote workers and collaborating across continents.

# The Problem
1. It is difficult to plan events across multiple timezones. 
2. When contacting a remote worker, knowing what time it is over there requires remembering the time difference or checking using another tool
3. www.worldtimebuddy.com is helpful but cumbersome to use because of visual clutter and too many buttons, links etc.
4. Other chrome extensions are ugly, hard to use or both. More examples to follow.
