# MultiClock
This is a Chrome extension that shows multiple clocks in chrome new tabs. It is useful for remote workers and collaborating across timezones.

This README describes both the app and the design process during conception of the app. Likewise, this repository contains the app itself and documents generated during the design process.

Please read the LICENSE file in this repository before modifying or distributing this software. 

# The Problem
1. It is difficult to plan events across multiple timezones because it requires knowing how everyones' work days overlap.
2. When contacting a remote worker, knowing what time it is in their home requires remembering the time difference or checking using another tool.
3. Existing chrome extensions are ugly, hard to use or both. 
4. Apps and web services exist that solve this problem, but there is high friction (need to open an app or access a page) in starting them up.

# Goals
1. App should be very low friction and require the least amount of interaction or concentration to solve the problem.
2. App should be aesthetically pleasing.
